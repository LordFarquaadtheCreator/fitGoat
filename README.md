## Inspiration
**Problem**
Personal Trainers: 60-120$ / hr
Dietitians: Insurance + can be upwards of $1,000
Appointment with Doctor to discuss diagnosis: Not accessible to all & wait times are insane. 

**Common Issue**
A common reservation everyone in the group has was the current culture of referees vs do'ers.
More people are willing to post/tell you what needs to be done, but they are not providing something the average busy American with a family can actually implement. This leads to guilt, analysis paralysis, and self-pity. This is why we created a toolbox, rather than a booklet. 

Another common experience was a lack of education in the field of nutrition, fitness, and neuroscience. Without great knowledge, comes great levels of powerlessness; we've all spent countless hours looking up the right diet/routine, just to get sucked into the vortex of online fitness influencers providing unsound advice.

## What we learned
To quote Fight Club "Self-improvement is {you know what they said}. Now self-destruction {construction*} is the answer."
We all now have tools to take with us in our lifelong fitness endeavors.

More about the field of Nutritional Psychiatry, we believe it is going to be a prevailing field 
1) because of it's legitimacy and efficacy.
2) because the mental health crisis isn't easy up, and we don't want to continue losing our generation to what starts as surface mental health issues and progressively compounds into a Neurogenerative disease.

## Evidence-Based
**Earlier studies have shown that symptoms of depression are linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.**
- Alzinfo

**Many studies have found a link between anxiety-prone personality and shortened lifespan.**
- VeryWellMind

**What do diabetes and dementia have in common? Studies have shown thatÂ type 2 diabetes can be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and other types of dementia. This is because the same cardiovascular problems that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes also increase the risk dementia.**
-Alzheimers.Ca

**You may be surprised to learn that being overweight or having obesity are linked with a higher risk of getting 13 types of cancer. These cancers make up 40% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States each year.**
-CDC

**Several small human trials have suggested a time-limited benefit of ketosis in delaying cognitive decline in older adults in various stages of dementia. The benefit seems to be particularly true in people without the apolipoprotein E4 allele.**
