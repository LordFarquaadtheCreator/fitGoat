Incorporating more physical activity and a balanced diet into your daily routine can make a significant difference. \n\nIn terms of exercise, a resistance training routine can be a great place to start. Here's a simple routine for beginners:\n\n1. *SQUATS: \nStand with your feet hip-width apart. Bend your knees and lower your hips as if you're sitting in a chair. Aim for 3 sets of 10 squats. This exercise engages your quads and glutes, which can improve your overall strength and stability.\n\n2. *PUSH-UPS: \nStart in a plank position. Lower your body until your chest almost touches the floor. Keep your elbows close to your body as you push back up. Try for 3 sets of 5 push-ups. This is great for building strength in your arms, shoulders, and chest.\n\n3. *LUNGES: \nStand straight with your shoulders back. Step forward with one foot and lower your body until your front knee is at a 90-degree angle. Then push up to return to your starting position. Try for 2 sets of 10 lunges on each side. This exercise works your hips, glutes, quads, and hamstrings.\n\nPlease remember to listen to your body and take breaks when needed. \n\nFor your DIET, we are going for all-encompassing nutritional psychiatry (relationship between diet~mental health) as well as physical health + longevity, focusing on incorporating anti-inflammatory, high protein and whole foods. Here's a simple meal suggestion:\n\n- Breakfast: Overnight oats topped with mixed berries (rich in antioxidants)\n- Lunch: Grilled chicken salad with dark leafy greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and olive oil dressing (rich in protein and various vitamins)\n- Dinner: Baked salmon with a side of quinoa and steamed broccoli (rich in omega-3 fatty acids for brain health)\n- Snacks: A handful of almonds or carrot sticks with hummus.\n\nRemember, sustainability is key! Don't crash diet, to get results faster; our goal is healthspan & lifespan, so we can enjoy everything life has to offer, as deeply as possible, as long as possible.\n\nIt's important to note that every person's body works differently, so what works well for others may not work the same for you. Please consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your routine.\n\nRemember, the journey to better health isn't about perfection, but about making small, sustainable changes. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š"
